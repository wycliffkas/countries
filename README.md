### Objective

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

### Brief

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.


Your users should be able to:

-   See all countries from the API on the homepage
-   Search for a country using an `input` field
-   Filter countries by region
-   Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
-   Click through to the border countries on the detail page
-   Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **TypeScript** and **React** best practices
-   Completeness: Did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: Does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: Is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: Is the system adequately tested?

### Run the application
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
